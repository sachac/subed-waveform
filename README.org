* subed-waveform

This package uses the [[https://www.ffmpeg.org/][FFMPEG command-line tool]] to display waveforms
next to the current subtitle in a =subed= buffer.  This can be a handy
way to fine-tune the start and stop times of a subtitle.

subed.el is not yet available as a package, but can be downloaded from
https://github.com/rndusr/subed . It supports SRT and WebVTT files.

If images are not displayed, you may want to make sure =max-image-size=
is set to a value that allows short, wide images.  The following code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
(add-hook 'subed-mode (lambda () (setq-local max-image-size nil)))
#+end_src

may do the trick.
